## 💬 SENTIMENT – Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning

This notebook performs **sentiment analysis** on text data using deep learning models built with **Keras and TensorFlow**. It classifies text into positive or negative sentiments and demonstrates the complete NLP pipeline from preprocessing to prediction.

### 🧠 Key Features
- Binary sentiment classification (Positive / Negative)  
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, padding, word embeddings  
- Deep learning model using LSTM or Dense layers  
- Visualization of training accuracy and loss  
- Built for educational and applied NLP tasks  

### 📁 File
- `SENTIMENT.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full training and testing pipeline

### ✅ Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras nltk
